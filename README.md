Welcome to my Frogger-style game!

How to Play:

The rules are simple.  Use the arrow keys to control the player and avoid the moving bugs, they are the enemy!  Also, don't step in the water!! Collect gems to score points. Your ultimate goal is the key at the end.  
Have fun!

How to Start Game:

You will need to download the application to a local directory, simply by clicking <a href="https://github.com/cgroce2/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/archive/master.zip">this link</a> and unzipping the file.

To run the application, simply open the 'index.html' file in any Internet browser that runs JavaScript. For most users, this is as simple as double-clicking the index file, otherwise by right-clicking the index and selecting a browser with which to open it.

Please note the app will not work if you try to open the index file directly from GitHub, which will instead present the file's source code in a viewer hosted on their site.
